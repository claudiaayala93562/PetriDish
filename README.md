# PetriDish
This is a class activity for Morgan Vigil's CS 16 class.
Eventually, this project will become a "Game of Life" simulation.

It is written in C++ and gives students the opportunity to practice
writing code that uses structures, dynamic arrays, pointers, compound 
data structures. As students develop their own version of PetriDish
they should use it as part of their project portfolio.
